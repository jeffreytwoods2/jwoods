## Build Details

I made this app with Go, HTMX, and Postgres. I love the simplicity of that 
design and am constantly impressed with how much one can do with just these 
tools.

It has several features of progressive web apps, namely that it is installable 
to your home screen and behaves natively when used standalone. It also has a 
robust webmanifest and uses service workers to cache static assets; one day I 
hope to find a good reason to have the service workers help the app behave well 
offline, but I don't want to build a solution looking for a problem, so the service 
workers don't do much for now.
