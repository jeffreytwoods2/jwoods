	You've been meaning to escape this job for years. Between the nepotism, office politics, and
	budget cuts, there's no hope for making it past Assistant to the Regional Manager. You've been
	eyeing web dev for quite some time, and are ready to take the plunge. You're going to learn to
	code.
</p>
<p>
	The internet told you not to reinvent the wheel; almost every problem on the web has been solved
	by a framework. Django sounds easy, so you ask Reddit to confirm that you're making the right
	choice before you begin your journey.
</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
	<p>"Python doesn't scale!"</p>
	<p>"MVC frameworks are dead."</p>
	<p>"Django?? Recruiters will wonder if you can even code!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	You remove Django from your computer and wash your hands. Reddit saved you from making the mistake
	of a lifetime; what a relief! Back at square one, you browse through your bookmarks and find that
	meme you liked about real wizards using PHP. That sounds like a plan, so you take to Reddit again,
	this time to discuss some <i>real</i> web technology.
</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
	<p>"PHP is a fractal of bad design!"</p>
	<p>"My old boss made me write PHP once; I needed months of therapy after quitting that job."</p>
	<p>"PHP?? But SvelteKit has a docker image now!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway I'll finish this article later, this website is taking up my whole Christmas break.</p>
